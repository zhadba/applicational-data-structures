The purpose of this repository is to house examples and notes on some common data structures. 
There are several folders, including information on:

 - Arrays
 - Binary Trees
 - Disjoint Sets (Union Find)
 - Hash Tables
 - Linked Lists
 - Queues
 - Stacks

All folders should have some python based examples and accompanying, language transcendent notes 
about their purposes and applications.
