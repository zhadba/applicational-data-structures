DYNAMIC ARRAY

    DEFINITION: Much like a static array, but can be scaled in size (larger or smaller).
    
    APPLICATIONS:

    - Create a static array with an initial capacity.
    - Add elements to an underlying static array, keeping track of the # of elements.
    - If static array exceeds capacity, make a new one with the same info + double the space.
      (generally filled with placeholders) to add the new element. 

    COMPLEXITY:

    ----------------
    Accessing | O(1)
    Searching | O(n)
    Insertion | O(n)
    Appending | O(1)
    Deletion  | O(n)
    ----------------

VISUAL EXAMPLE (where brackets = cell):

                A = [034][004]
    A.add(-7)   A = [034][004][-07]
    A.remove(4) A = [034][-07]

    *same indexing rules as static arrays apply here.
